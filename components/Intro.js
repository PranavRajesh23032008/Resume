              Hey! I am Pranav! I've been coding for over an year now. As a
              beginner to Programming, I started off with Python and over time,
              I started with Web Developement. I totally fell in Love with Web
              Developement. Eventually, I started learning ReactJS and started
              enjoying it. I am currently working on many projects which use
              ReactJS. My dream is to become a Full-Stack developer of a big
              tech company in the near future.
